Task 4: Setup and Use a Firewall on Windows
--------------------------------------------

Objective: Configure and test basic firewall rules to allow or block traffic using Windows Firewall.

# Step 1: Open Windows Firewall GUI
- Press Windows Key > Search "Windows Defender Firewall" > Open it.

# Step 2: View Current Firewall Rules
- Click "Advanced Settings" > View Inbound and Outbound Rules

# Step 3: Block Port 23 (Telnet)
- Go to "Inbound Rules" > Click "New Rule..."
- Select "Port" > TCP > Specific port: 23
- Choose "Block the connection"
- Apply to all profiles
- Name it: "Block Telnet Port 23"

# Step 4: Test Telnet Block (Telnet was not installed)
- Attempted command: `telnet 127.0.0.1 23`
- Result: 'telnet' is not recognized (default on many Windows 10/11 systems)

# Step 5: Allow SSH (Port 22)
- Create another Inbound Rule for port 22:
- Allow the connection > All profiles > Name: "Allow SSH Port 22"

# Step 6: Remove Telnet Block Rule
- Go to "Inbound Rules"
- Right-click "Block Telnet Port 23" > Delete

# Step 7: Security and System Stability
- No software was installed.
- No internet, performance, or network settings were affected.
- All changes were GUI-based and safely reverted.

Summary:
- A firewall filters traffic by inspecting incoming/outgoing packets and applying rules.
- Blocking Telnet is best practice as it's an insecure protocol.
